# Hacker "Bombs" that need to be defused

Puzzle programs students need to use a debugger to solve.

**No modifications of the source code are necessary to solve these puzzles.** All steps necessary to defuse the bombs can be accomplished with the debugger, and in the case of the `HarderHackerBomb`, students should not even need to use the debugger to modify any variable values at runtime.
